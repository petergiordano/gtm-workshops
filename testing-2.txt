OTHER:
- for all activity html file with more than 1 step, add a back button to go back one step (except for first 'page' of the activity where the choices would be go back to current workshop or go back to all workshops)
- Every activity html file needs to have the title of the workshop and specific activity listed at the top. For example, the file ecp-activity-1.html should show "Finding your Early Customers: Early Market vs Mainstream Identification" at the top of each of the 'pages' in the activity. this should be in the sticky header so the user can always see it.

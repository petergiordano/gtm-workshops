## Branching Strategy & Deployment

This repository uses a clean branching model to separate stable MVP code from active development and production.

- **main**: Live GitHub Pages site. Contains embedded test data and dev mode tools.
- **original-mvp**: Archived first version of the repo with legacy progress code logic.
- **bolt-migration**: Future branch for migrating to a React-based app using bolt.new.

GitHub Pages is served from the `main` branch. Visit: https://petergiordano.github.io/gtm-workshops/

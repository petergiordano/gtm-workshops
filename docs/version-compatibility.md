# Version Compatibility Matrix

## Progress Code Versions

### Version 1.0 (Current)
- **Released**: June 2025
- **Structure**: Basic 4-day workshop data
- **Compatibility**: N/A (first version)

### Future Version Planning

#### Version 1.1 (Planned)

## Migration Strategy

When implementing new versions:
1. Increment version number in data structure
2. Add migration function for previous versions
3. Test with sample data from all previous versions
4. Document changes in this matrix

## Testing Version Compatibility

Always test with progress codes from:
- Empty state (new user)
- Partial completion (some workshops done)
- Full completion (all workshops done)
- Previous version data

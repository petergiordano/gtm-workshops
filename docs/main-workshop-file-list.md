OTHER:
- for all activity html file with more than 1 step, add a back button to go back one step (except for first 'page' of the activity where the choices would be go back to current workshop or go back to all workshops)
- Every activity html file needs to have the title of the workshop and specific activity listed at the top. For example, the file ecp-activity-1.html should show "Finding your Early Customers: Early Market vs Mainstream Identification" at the top of each of the 'pages' in the activity. this should be in the sticky header so the user can always see it.
- make sure the "Generate Progress Code" option is available on the last step of each activity.
- make sure there is enough space between all buttons at the bottom of the page of the last step of all activites html failures
- all activity html files need the standard array of buttons on the last step of the activity: back, generate progress code, go to next workshop
- for problems-activity-3.html, claude code implemented a ux where once the user clicks the generate code button, the button changes to "Return to workshop" as seen in the screen shot. I like this ux and we need to make it standard and make sure all html files do that as well.

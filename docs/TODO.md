#### **Gemini Specifications for Week 9: Map Buyer Stakeholders**

##### **1. Activity Titles and Descriptions**

* **Activity 1: Map the Buying Jobs**
  * **Description:** The B2B buying process isn't a simple funnel; it's a complex journey where customers must complete six distinct "jobs" to reach a decision. In this activity, you will analyze your customer's journey to identify the 2-3 jobs that are the most difficult or create the most friction. This crucial first step forces you to see the deal from your customer's perspective and identifies the exact points of leverage where your sales process can add the most value.

* **Activity 2: Assign Personas to Roles**
  * **Description:** You are never selling to one person; you are selling to a committee of 6-10 people with different motivations and priorities. This activity moves beyond simple org charts to build a sophisticated stakeholder map. You will identify the key players, distinguish their company role from their "buying persona" (e.g., Champion, Blocker, Economic Buyer), and articulate the specific goals and challenges that drive their decision-making process.

* **Activity 3: Develop a Buyer Enablement Plan**
  * **Description:** A staggering 83% of the buying process happens when you are not in the room. Your success depends on your ability to arm your internal champion to sell on your behalf. In this final activity, you will translate your stakeholder map into an actionable plan. You will create specific "prescriptions"â€”tangible assets like an ROI calculator or a security briefâ€”designed to help your champion overcome objections and build consensus within the buying group.

##### **2. Detailed Field Specifications for Each Activity**

###### **Activity 1: Map the Buying Jobs**

* **Input Fields:** 2
* **How it builds on previous activities:** This is the foundational activity that sets the strategic context for the entire workshop.

| Field Name (Variable) | Label | Input Type | Placeholder/Options | Tooltip | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `selectedBuyingJobs` | Select the top 2-3 most difficult buying jobs. | Checkbox Group | **Options:** `Problem Identification`, `Solution Exploration`, `Requirements Building`, `Supplier Selection`, `Validation`, `Consensus Creation` | Choose the jobs where your customer's buying process most often stalls or breaks down. | Required, select 2-3. |
| `buyingJobsJustification` | Why are these jobs the most difficult for your customer? | Textarea | "e.g., Our customers struggle most with Consensus Creation because the purchase involves three departments (Engineering, Finance, Security) with conflicting priorities. Getting them to agree on a budget and a timeline is where deals stall." | Think about where your deals get stuck. Is it identifying the problem, or getting 10 stakeholders to agree? This is the friction your sales process must solve. | Required, min 15 words. |

###### **Activity 2: Assign Personas to Roles**

* **Input Fields:** 1 dynamic component (array of objects), containing 4 fields per stakeholder.
* **How it builds on Activity 1:** Understanding the most difficult "buying jobs" (Activity 1) provides the essential context for why certain stakeholders have the goals and challenges they do. If "Consensus Creation" is a top challenge, the goals of the Champion and the challenges of the Blocker become much clearer.

| Field Name (Variable) | Label | Input Type | Placeholder | Tooltip | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stakeholders` (Array) | N/A (This is the container) | Dynamic Cards | N/A | Add 3-5 key players in the buying committee. | Required, min 3 stakeholders. |
| `functionalRole` | Functional Role | Text Input | "e.g., Head of DevOps" | The person's function, not their specific title (e.g., 'Sales Leadership' vs. 'SVP of Sales'). | Required, min 3 words. |
| `stakeholderPersona` | Buying Persona | Select/Dropdown | **Options:** `Champion`, `Economic Buyer`, `Technical Buyer`, `Decision Maker`, `End User`, `Blocker`, `Influencer` | The role this person plays in *this specific* purchase decision, regardless of their title. | Required. |
| `keyGoals` | Key Goals & Motivations | Textarea | "e.g., Reduce P1 incidents by 50%, improve team efficiency, link engineering metrics to business outcomes." | Use the buyer's language, not yours. Focus on business outcomes, not product features. | Required, min 10 words. |
| `challenges` | Challenges & Pains | Textarea | "e.g., Spends 10+ hours a week firefighting reactive alerts. Constantly pulled away from core development to fix outages." | Focus on pain points that can be tied to ROI (time, money, risk). | Required, min 10 words. |

###### **Activity 3: Develop a Buyer Enablement Plan**

* **Input Fields:** 1 dynamic component (array of objects), containing 3 fields per "prescription."
* **How it synthesizes Activities 1 & 2:** This is the action plan. The `targetStakeholder` dropdown is dynamically populated from the stakeholders mapped in Activity 2. The "prescriptions" you create are the solution to help the customer overcome the difficult "buying jobs" identified in Activity 1.

| Field Name (Variable) | Label | Input Type | Placeholder | Tooltip | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prescriptions` (Array) | N/A (This is the container) | Dynamic Rows | N/A | Add at least 2 specific 'prescriptions' to arm your champion. | Required, min 2 prescriptions. |
| `targetStakeholder` | Target Stakeholder | Select/Dropdown | (Dynamically populated with `functionalRole` from Activity 2) | Who does your champion need to convince? This list is pulled directly from the stakeholders you mapped in Activity 2. | Required. |
| `primaryBarrier` | Primary Barrier / Objection | Textarea | "e.g., The CFO believes our existing monitoring tools are 'good enough' and doesn't see the ROI of a predictive solution." | What is the single biggest reason this person would say 'no' or delay the deal? | Required, min 10 words. |
| `enablementArtifact` | Enablement Artifact (Your 'Prescription') | Textarea | "e.g., A 1-page ROI calculator showing a 6-month payback period. Arm our champion with this for their budget meeting." | What specific, tangible asset can you create to help your champion overcome this barrier? (e.g., ROI Calculator, Security Brief) | Required, min 10 words. |

}
```

##### **4. Stakeholder Mapping Concepts**

* **Frameworks Used:**
  * **Gartner's 6 B2B Buying Jobs:** This is the core framework for understanding the customer's process. It re-frames the sale away from a linear funnel and towards a set of non-linear tasks the customer must complete.
  * **Company Role vs. Buying Persona:** This framework, based on common B2B sales methodologies, is used to map the people involved. We distinguish a person's title (e.g., CFO) from their role in the deal (e.g., Economic Buyer, Blocker).
  * **Buyer Enablement ("Prescriptions"):** This is the action-oriented framework for the output, focusing on creating assets to help the internal champion drive the deal forward.
  
* **Stakeholder Connection to Buyer Journey:** Stakeholders are uncovered by asking discovery questions related to the 6 Buying Jobs. For example, asking "Who is involved in building the business case for this project?" helps identify the Champion and the Economic Buyer involved in the "Consensus Creation" job.

* **Key Insights for Users:**
  1. **Empathy:** Your sales process is irrelevant; only the customer's buying process matters. You must align with their "jobs-to-be-done".
  2. **Complexity:** You are selling to a diverse committee, not an individual. Each member has different, often conflicting, goals that you must understand and navigate.
  3. **Enablement:** Your primary job is to equip your internal champion to win the 83% of the sales cycle where you are absent. Your success is their success.

##### **5. Workshop Metadata for index.html**

* **Workshop Title:** `How to Map Buying Stakeholders`
* **Workshop Description:** "This workshop provides a structured process for identifying the key players in a complex B2B sales motion. You will learn to move beyond job titles to understand the motivations, challenges, and buying personas of each stakeholder, and build an actionable plan to drive consensus and close deals."
* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Differentiate your sales process from the customer's non-linear buying process.
  * Identify the 6 "buying jobs" that drive a purchase decision for your customer.
  * Create a detailed stakeholder map with roles, personas, and motivations.
  * Develop an actionable "buyer enablement" plan to equip your champion and accelerate deals.
* **Activity Card Descriptions:**
  * **Card 1:** "Map the Buying Jobs - Identify the 2-3 most critical and difficult 'jobs' your customer must complete to make a purchase."
  * **Card 2:** "Assign Personas to Roles - Build a detailed map of the buying group, defining each stakeholder's functional role, buying persona, and key motivations."
  * **Card 3:** "Develop a Buyer Enablement Plan - Translate your map into action. Create 'prescriptions' to help your champion overcome objections and build consensus."

##### **6. Export Format Structure**

The markdown export should be structured as follows to provide a clear, shareable artifact.

*(...repeat for all created prescriptions...)*
```

##### **7. Buyer Journey Integration**

* **Journey Stages:** We are explicitly **not** using a traditional, linear buyer journey (e.g., Awareness, Consideration, Decision). The workshop's core concept is mapping to **Gartner's 6 non-linear Buying Jobs**, which happen concurrently and are revisited throughout the process.
* **Stakeholder Appearance:** Stakeholders appear and have peak influence during different "jobs." For example:
  * `End User` is most influential during **Problem Identification** and **Validation**.
  * `Technical Buyer` is most influential during **Solution Exploration** and **Requirements Building**.
  * `Economic Buyer` and `Blockers` are most influential during **Consensus Creation**.
* **B2B Patterns to Emphasize:**
  * **The "Buying Group" is the Customer:** Reinforce that the target is a committee of 6-10 people, not a single lead.
  * **The Invisible Sale:** Emphasize that 83% of the buying process happens without a sales rep present, making the role of the champion and buyer enablement critical.
  * **Non-Linearity:** The customer's path is chaotic. They may be working on "Supplier Selection" and "Problem Identification" at the same time. The goal is not to force them down a funnel but to help them complete their jobs.

# TODO - Workshop Progress Code Implementation

## Immediate Tasks

### Implementation Priority
- [x] âœ… Implement Progress Code in Day 2-2 Activity 1 (pilot) - COMPLETE
- [x] âœ… Test complete flow through all 3 positioning activities - COMPLETE
- [x] âœ… Roll out to remaining Day 2-2 activities - COMPLETE
- [ ] Implement in Day 1 activities
- [x] âœ… Implement in Day 2-1 activities - COMPLETE (June 9, 2025)
- [x] âœ… Implement in Day 3 (Market Entry Readiness) activities - Activity 1 COMPLETE (June 12, 2025)

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Add examples of actual progress codes to technical docs
- [ ] Create user-facing help documentation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Known Issues

### Naming Clarification âœ“
- [x] Day numbering is by track, not chronological order:
  - `day1` = Problems Worth Solving (chronologically Day 1)
  - `day2_1` = Finding Your Early Customers (chronologically Day 2 AM)
  - `day2_2` = Positioning Basics (chronologically Day 2 PM)
  - `day3` = Market Entry Readiness (chronologically Day 4)
- [x] **RESOLVED**: Added clarifying comments and documentation to explain naming convention
- [ ] Consider future renaming to avoid confusion (e.g., `problems`, `customers`, `positioning`, `market_entry`)

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Implement progress code versioning system
- [ ] Add data migration strategy for schema changes
- [ ] Consider compression if codes exceed 2000 chars
- [ ] Add analytics to track usage patterns

## Future Enhancements

### User Experience
- [ ] Add visual progress indicator showing completed workshops
- [ ] Implement "Quick Save" button that copies code automatically
- [ ] Add QR code generation for easier mobile sharing
- [ ] Create progress dashboard showing all completed activities

### Data Management
- [ ] Add optional cloud backup (with user consent)
- [ ] Implement data export to PDF report
- [ ] Add team/cohort code sharing features
- [ ] Create instructor view to see cohort progress

### Track 2 Workshops
- [ ] Design data schema for Days 5-10 (Advanced GTM)
- [ ] Determine which Track 2 activities need persistence
- [ ] Plan integration with Track 1 data

## Testing Requirements

### Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Chrome Mobile (Android)

### Scenarios to Test
- [ ] 30 concurrent users
- [ ] Invalid code handling
- [ ] Partial data import
- [ ] Maximum data size
- [ ] Copy/paste on all platforms
- [ ] Network offline handling

## Questions to Resolve

### Design Decisions
- [ ] Should we show a preview of imported data before applying?
- [ ] How to handle version conflicts if schema changes?
- [ ] Should activities lock after completion to preserve progress codes?
- [ ] Add "confidence score" to show how much data was successfully imported?

### Workshop Flow
- [ ] Can users skip workshops and still use progress codes?
- [ ] Should we enforce prerequisites (e.g., must complete Day 1 before Day 2)?
- [ ] How to handle users who want to redo an activity?

## Archive Note

*Historical implementation details for Progress Code system and legacy development phases have been archived. All 12 core workshop activities are now implemented using the embedded test data system with dev mode functionality and professional markdown export.*

*For current development status and next steps, see the Project Documentation section below.*

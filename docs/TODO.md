# TODO - Workshop Progress Code Implementation

## Immediate Tasks

### Implementation Priority
- [ ] Implement Progress Code in Day 2-2 Activity 1 (pilot)
- [ ] Test complete flow through all 3 positioning activities
- [ ] Roll out to remaining Day 2-2 activities
- [ ] Implement in Day 1 activities
- [ ] Implement in Day 2-1 activities
- [ ] Implement in Day 3 (Market Entry Readiness) activities

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Add examples of actual progress codes to technical docs
- [ ] Create user-facing help documentation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Known Issues

### Naming Clarification ✓
- [x] Day numbering is by track, not chronological order:
  - `day1` = Problems Worth Solving (chronologically Day 1)
  - `day2_1` = Finding Your Early Customers (chronologically Day 2 AM)
  - `day2_2` = Positioning Basics (chronologically Day 2 PM)
  - `day3` = Market Entry Readiness (chronologically Day 4)
- [x] **RESOLVED**: Added clarifying comments and documentation to explain naming convention
- [ ] Consider future renaming to avoid confusion (e.g., `problems`, `customers`, `positioning`, `market_entry`)

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Implement progress code versioning system
- [ ] Add data migration strategy for schema changes
- [ ] Consider compression if codes exceed 2000 chars
- [ ] Add analytics to track usage patterns

## Future Enhancements

### User Experience
- [ ] Add visual progress indicator showing completed workshops
- [ ] Implement "Quick Save" button that copies code automatically
- [ ] Add QR code generation for easier mobile sharing
- [ ] Create progress dashboard showing all completed activities

### Data Management
- [ ] Add optional cloud backup (with user consent)
- [ ] Implement data export to PDF report
- [ ] Add team/cohort code sharing features
- [ ] Create instructor view to see cohort progress

### Track 2 Workshops
- [ ] Design data schema for Days 5-10 (Advanced GTM)
- [ ] Determine which Track 2 activities need persistence
- [ ] Plan integration with Track 1 data

## Testing Requirements

### Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Chrome Mobile (Android)

### Scenarios to Test
- [ ] 30 concurrent users
- [ ] Invalid code handling
- [ ] Partial data import
- [ ] Maximum data size
- [ ] Copy/paste on all platforms
- [ ] Network offline handling

## Questions to Resolve

### Design Decisions
- [ ] Should we show a preview of imported data before applying?
- [ ] How to handle version conflicts if schema changes?
- [ ] Should activities lock after completion to preserve progress codes?
- [ ] Add "confidence score" to show how much data was successfully imported?

### Workshop Flow
- [ ] Can users skip workshops and still use progress codes?
- [ ] Should we enforce prerequisites (e.g., must complete Day 1 before Day 2)?
- [ ] How to handle users who want to redo an activity?

## Notes

### Implementation Order Rationale
Starting with Day 2-2 because:
1. Moderate complexity (not too simple, not too complex)
2. Clear data dependencies from previous workshops
3. Three activities that build on each other
4. Good test case for both import and export

### Data Size Estimates
Current rough estimates for encoded data:
- Day 1 complete: ~400-600 chars
- Day 2-1 complete: ~300-500 chars
- Day 2-2 complete: ~500-700 chars
- Day 3 complete: ~400-600 chars
- **Total: ~1600-2400 chars** (need to monitor and potentially compress)

## Completed Tasks ✓
- [x] Create Progress Code system PRD
- [x] Design data schema
- [x] Create technical implementation guide
- [x] Update activity standards with UI patterns
- [x] Document implementation decisions
- [x] Fix markdown formatting in data-schema.md and technical-implementation.md
- [x] Add workshop naming convention clarifications to all documentation
- [x] Update all references to clarify day3 = Market Entry Readiness (chronologically 4th workshop)

## Current Status (Updated)
- **Phase**: Documentation/planning phase complete
- **Implementation**: No code implementation yet
- **Documentation**: All technical patterns documented and reviewed
- **Next**: Ready to verify documentation coherence before proceeding to implementation

## Session Progress
- [x] Fixed markdown formatting issues in technical docs
- [x] Clarified workshop naming convention across all documentation
- [x] Resolved day3 naming confusion (Market Entry Readiness = chronologically 4th workshop)
- [x] Updated TODO.md with current status
- [x] Created comprehensive progress-code-system.md PRD
- [x] Completed implementation-decisions.md with architectural rationale
- [x] Verified documentation coherence - all files aligned
- [x] Fixed UI mock alignment in progress-code-system.md
- [x] Added missing implementation patterns to technical-implementation.md
- [x] Updated import behavior documentation

## Documentation Alignment Fixes Completed
- [x] **UI Mocks Updated**: Import section now shows "Continue Your Progress" with FileText icon and correct button text
- [x] **Export Section Fixed**: Now shows "Activity Complete! Save Your Progress" with success icon and "Copy Code" button
- [x] **Safari Clipboard Fallback**: Added cross-browser clipboard copy implementation
- [x] **Version Mismatch Handling**: Added version compatibility checking pattern
- [x] **Partial Data Import**: Added validation and recovery pattern for incomplete data
- [x] **Import Behavior Clarified**: Auto-hide timing updated to 3 seconds with user feedback

## Documentation Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION READY
All documentation files are now aligned and comprehensive:
- Complete Progress Code system PRD with accurate UI mockups
- Technical implementation guide with all necessary code patterns
- Architectural decisions documented with clear rationale
- Data schema and validation rules defined
- Browser compatibility and error handling covered

## Immediate Next Steps
1. [ ] Begin Progress Code implementation in positioning-activity-1.html
2. [ ] Test complete data flow through all three Day 2-2 activities
3. [ ] Validate technical patterns work end-to-end
4. [ ] Expand to remaining workshop activities

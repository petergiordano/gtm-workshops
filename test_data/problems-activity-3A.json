  "problemStatement": "Development teams struggle to prevent API failures before they impact customers. Current monitoring solutions are reactive, not predictive, leading to significant costsâ€”approximately $100,000 per hour in lost revenue for each failure and high operational costs due to downtime and manual interventions. This negatively impacts overall profitability and operational efficiency.",
  "urgencyScore": 5,
  "urgencyEvidence": "API failures cost $100k/hr. Teams need immediate alerts, and companies where API failures cost $100k+/hour are prioritizing systems ensuring business continuity. This indicates a clear and immediate pain point.",

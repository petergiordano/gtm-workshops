  "selectedMetric": "B",
  "rationale": "Our customers process millions of API calls daily and their usage directly correlates with the business value they get from our predictive monitoring platform.",
  "problemSolved": "Eliminates the need for complex infrastructure scaling decisions and prevents costly downtime incidents before they occur.",
  "pricePerUnit": "0.001",
  "baseComponent": "subscription",
  "valueScaling": "usage",
  "customerJustification": "Monthly subscription covers our infrastructure and platform costs while usage-based scaling ensures customers only pay more when they're getting more value from monitoring additional API calls.",
  "customerExplanation": "Pay a monthly base fee for access to our monitoring platform, plus a small per-API-call fee that scales with your usage and the value you receive.",
  "potentialChallenge": "Usage spikes during peak traffic could cause unexpected bill increases - we'd address this with usage alerts, spending caps, and graduated pricing tiers to prevent bill shock.",
